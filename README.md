Rebuilding server.
My server should only handle the emails and sending them to the database.
no need for the server to handle the books logic i can leave them foe the client

i have to relearn Fetch api , to be able too know why my api from client to server.

30-Mar
The automatic downloads for the pdf and audio files are are now working.
And finally , the form data for books and newsletter working.
Both are sending data form clinet and the Server is reciving and logging it to the console for now.
Next step is to send all the data from the server to the database.

31-Mar
Newsletter email and Books email are sending together to the same route and not seperate anymore.
Still need to create an admin page for the client to be able to see the emails to those that have sent thier emails.
or find a way too send email notifications.
still done know what i will use to create this admin panel , mayne javascript or PHP ( meaning i will need too learn PHP) just to be able to finish this project.
